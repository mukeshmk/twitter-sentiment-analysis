2020-02-02 02:03:46,aburnsmoves,,0,0,Why Fine Gael because progress is for all. If you’re like me you get off your arse and go do something about it. If you’re in need you talk to someone in FG like me and get help. We all need someone with a Fine Gael outlook. #GE2020 #LookForward #FineGael,,#GE2020 #LookForward #FineGael,https://twitter.com/aburnsmoves/status/1223789072021446656

2020-02-02 01:54:47,aburnsmoves,,0,0,We gave it everything to keep things going but it was that Fine Gael mentality haunting us again. We had been defeated in #LE19 but were still capable. Defeated but no less responsible.

2020-02-02 01:42:58,aburnsmoves,,0,0,In #LE19 we met people who couldn’t advocate effectively for themselves or their community. I was shocked. I grew up in Togher on the 90s a disadvantaged area. I had seen this before. Somehow my parents managed to coach us onto a different path. #GE2020 #LookForward #FineGael,,#LE19 #GE2020 #LookForward #FineGael,https://twitter.com/aburnsmoves/status/1223783836376621056

2020-02-02 01:23:36,aburnsmoves,,0,1,Half of the Fianna Fáil party voted No in the 8th amendment campaign. I’m really worried here. Did they not trust families to make their own hard choices. Did they not care enough to make sure help was available??
